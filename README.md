# GitHub User Search App (Frontend Mentor)

Hi all ðŸ‘‹

This is my personal solution to the [GitHub user search app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge revolves around a web application for querying user profiles on GitHub and to display summary statistics and external links with a sleek, responsive UI.

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Search for GitHub users by their username
-   See relevant user information based on their search
-   Switch between light and dark themes
-   Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.
